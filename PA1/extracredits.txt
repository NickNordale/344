I did the AJAX extra credit. You can trigger it by typing in the start of a player's name for example if you 
enter "johns", without hitting enter or clicking go, you will see the website return all the players that have names 
containing that string (I think they all have last name "Johnson" in this case). With that same query, if you delete the 's'
at the end of "johns" you will see the website filter back in all the additional players who's names contain "john".

I implemented this feature by using the jQuery AJAX method. I create a keyup function, so everytime there is a keyup on the
input element the ajax method does a get request to /index.php with the current search value. I think this would've been easier
to do if I split my php into separate files but I didn't want to so I basically get a whole new index.php pages back from my ajax 
request as a string. I then grab the part of that string that represents the query results and I set it as the html for my tbody
element.
